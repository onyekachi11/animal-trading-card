            The lion has been one of the best-known wild animals since earliest times. Lions are most active at night and live in a
            variety of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland

        <p class="second-paragraph">Historically, they ranged across much of Europe, Asia, and Africa, but now they are found mainly in parts of Africa
        south of the Sahara. An isolated population of about 650 Asiatic lions constitute a slightly smaller race that lives
        under strict protection in Indiaâ€™s Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary.</p>
